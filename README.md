# Wefit ecommerce test

This project was made by Jo√£o Vitor Minosso in 29/03/2023

## Libraries

this project uses, React, Typescript, styled-components, json-server and context API.

I chosse contex API instead Redux because that project have just 4 screens variations, and localy I prefer use Context.

## Server

The server that feeds this aplication use JSON Server.

## Test

Automatized test aren't impleted yet.

# Running the project

### yarn install or npm install

Chose one of that and runs in the terminal in the root folder of the project.

### yarn start

Run this and wait the project initiate in the browser

## you need to have node and I recomend VSCode.

# Final considerations

## why not use Next?

because React Router is more understandable for someone that just know React.
